<p>The story of the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum
began ten years ago. The progression of events between the
first consideration of the memorial in 1944 and its completion
in 1952 was by no means smooth and uninterrupted. The
account of the solution of the problems involved in planning,
financing, and constructing the memorial constitutes a community
accomplishment.</p>
<p>The source material for this publication originated in
a speech delivered by Otto H. Adams at a meeting of the
Quest Club, November 6, 1953. Mr. Adams, recently
elected president of the Coliseum Board of Trustees, reviewed
the history of the Coliseum and discussed its value
to city and county in his paper entitled &ldquo;Coliseum&mdash;Asset or
Liability?&rdquo; James R. Fleming, the past president of the
Board of Trustees, A. M. Strauss, the architect, and Don
L. Myers, the coliseum manager, have supplied supplementary
information.</p>
<p>The Boards and the Staff of the Public Library of Fort
Wayne and Allen County present this pamphlet in the hope
that it will interest and inform the citizens of Allen County.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_1">1</div>
<p class="tb">In 1944 the Fort Wayne Junior Chamber of Commerce
first proposed the construction of a coliseum as a memorial
to the men and women of Allen County who had lost their
lives in both World Wars. Such a structure was envisioned
as serving a twofold purpose; it would honor our heroic dead
and would greatly increase recreational facilities. A Russell
Sage Foundation study was made after World War II; the
report indicates a definite trend among memorial planners to
erect &ldquo;living memorials,&rdquo; which serve the people while honoring
their heroes, rather than ornamental arches, statues,
and monuments. The Foundation believes that this trend is
commendable and hails it as a &ldquo;triumph of common sense
over sentimentalism.&rdquo; Contemporary opinion seems to be
that construction of a useful memorial in no way detracts
from the honor paid to the dead. On the contrary, it is felt
that the utility of the monument demonstrates our regard
for them more forcibly by benefiting that society for which
they died.</p>
<p>The members of the Junior Chamber of Commerce
conducted a survey of city residents and concluded that 78
per cent were in favor of the proposed coliseum. Two independent
occurrences in 1944 added impetus to the movement.
First, Psi Iota Xi Sorority sponsored an analysis of
recreational facilities estimated to be needed by the city for
a twenty-year period. The sorority submitted to the mayor
a plan drawn up by Elwood Allen and George Nesbitt of the
National Recreation Association. A memorial field house
was one of the major recommendations of the plan. A memorial
honoring General Anthony Wayne, the founder of the
city, was also proposed in 1944. This memorial, too, was
envisioned as a practical structure, and a field house was
one of the suggestions. Both state and national funds could
be employed to construct an Anthony Wayne memorial.</p>
<p>The Junior Chamber of Commerce survey determined
that popular opinion supported the project. Accordingly,
that association hired Mr. Allen, who had drawn up general
recreational plans for Fort Wayne, to make a further investigation
of possible sites and building plans. It was immediately
evident that a coliseum would be a costly construction;
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
the cost would probably exceed two million dollars.
The acquisition of funds was the first problem that
had to be solved. James R. Fleming presided over the
meeting at which the survey results were first discussed.
He suggested building a coliseum as a memorial both to the
dead of the two World Wars and to Anthony Wayne. He believed
that financial aid could be obtained from the federal
government in this way.</p>
<p>Despite general popular sentiment in Allen County favoring
the erection of a coliseum, the planners faced and
overcame many obstacles before their dream became a reality.
In 1945 plans were announced for a sports arena,
which was to be built by private enterprise in the Quimby
Village area. Had these plans been realized, the sports
arena would have been in direct competition with the Memorial
Coliseum. The next impediment was in the form
of objections to the proposed site; the residents of the Lawton
Park area, which was the first site recommended, were
vocal in their opposition.</p>
<p>Since at least a portion of the cost of a coliseum would
be financed by property taxes, in 1946 it was decided to submit
the question to the electorate of Allen County in the
form of a referendum. After the county commissioners had
agreed to place the question on the ballot, the Junior Chamber
of Commerce organized and carried out an extensive
publicity campaign to secure public approval. The War Memorial
Commission, a group organized with the encouragement
of the Junior Chamber of Commerce, assumed responsibility
for the planning and co-ordination of the campaign.
Don Myers was elected chairman. Conventional advertising
media were utilized: newspapers, radio broadcasts, direct
mail, and bus placards. In addition, public attention was
dramatically captured by dropping thousands of leaflets over
the city from a plane and by holding a torchlight parade on
election eve. A special appeal was made to high school
students. Commission speakers addressed student assemblies
and explained how the coliseum could enlarge school
sports programs. Buttons in school colors, advertising
the coliseum, were distributed at football games, and publicity
appeared in school newspapers. Although the planning
of this well-integrated program must be credited to the War
Memorial Commission, the Junior Chamber of Commerce
continued to give active support and co-operated to carry
out all phases of the fight.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Both major political parties endorsed the issue. The
chairmen of the Democratic and Republican central committees
signed a joint statement which advocated voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo;
on a project that would benefit every person in Allen County.
The average annual cost to the taxpayer would be only fifty-five
cents, it was stated. Many civic organizations pledged
their support. The Zollner Pistons played an exhibition
game and donated all proceeds to the War Memorial Commission.
The check for $1,700 was used for publicity to
win the support of the voters. The Civic Theatre also gave
a benefit performance for the cause. The Fort Wayne Civic
Association paid for advertisements explaining the benefits
of the proposed coliseum.</p>
<p>About this time, fearing that the sports arena function
of the coliseum was being overemphasized, the president of
the Junior Chamber of Commerce reiterated its primary
purpose: &ldquo;War memorials should be for the living, not for
the dead alone. The living must be enabled to derive a spiritual
lift from them. There must be a shrine to which one
may go to commune with the missing and to pay tribute to
the returned. A mere building does not serve this purpose.
The true memorial building has a heart, a focal point. Some
symbol within it must tell why the building was built, and
this must be the center of interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The results of the referendum of November 6, 1946,
must have gratified the commission; that organization had
endeavored to stimulate the public interest and approval
and had succeeded admirably. The vote was five to one in
favor of floating a bond issue to finance the memorial.</p>
<p>After the first World War, a law had been passed by
the state legislature permitting the county councils to issue
bonds for memorial purposes to the extent of &frac12; per cent
of the total property valuation of the county. Based on the
property valuation of Allen County in 1947, this proportion
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
would have been approximately one and one-half million dollars,
but it was evident that the cost of the proposed coliseum
would far exceed this amount. Public subscription and
federal aid were among the several sources considered for
obtaining the additional funds necessary to build the structure.
But these auxiliary sources were discarded in favor
of raising the ceiling of bonded indebtedness. A change in
the statute was proposed. A bill was formulated and sponsored
by the American Legion legislative committee. The
War Memorial Commission warmly praised Robert Gaskill,
chairman of the legislative committee, for his valuable assistance.
The bill was enacted, and in March, 1947, Governor
Ralph F. Gates signed the amended law increasing
the ceiling from &frac12; per cent to 1 per cent of the assessable
property in the county.</p>
<p>The majority of the voters of Allen County gave their
support to the planners of the War Memorial Coliseum and
were eager to have the preliminary work completed and the
construction begun. But a small minority argued that increasing
the indebtedness of the county was unjustifiable
and that the Coliseum would impose too heavy a burden on
the taxpayer. Some members of the minority attempted to
thwart the coliseum plans; they contended that the law permitted
the county to issue bonds for only one memorial and
that Fort Wayne already had a memorial in Memorial Park.
Both contentions were correct; if that memorial had really
been built with funds secured from a county bond issue, it
would have been illegal to finance the Coliseum by that
means. Investigation disclosed that the theory that the old
memorial was paid for by the county could not be substantiated.
Apparently, funds were secured largely through the
generous donations of individuals and were augmented by
public subscription. Again the commission turned to the
Indiana General Assembly, and this time the legislature
unanimously passed a bill declaring a bond issue for a memorial
coliseum legal.</p>
<p>The passage of the bill raising the amount of the bond
issue assured approximately three million dollars for the
memorial. The first decision facing the county commissioners
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
thereafter was the final selection of a site. On May
19, 1947, a joint meeting of the commissioners and the War
Memorial Commission heard Elwood Allen recommend the
Municipal Beach area. Mr. Allen cited the following sound
reasons for his choice: the tract is well drained, high, and
adequate in size to allow for future expansion; at the present
time, two thirds of the rural population of Allen County have
easy access to it; within the next few decades the center of
population probably will shift toward the north of the city.</p>
<p>For a brief period there was some dissension between
the county commissioners and the War Memorial Commission.
The members of the commission had accomplished
much of the preliminary work and felt that the commissioners
were not giving sufficient consideration to their recommendations.
Legally, the commissioners had the power of
final decision; as elected officials they could not delegate
authority to another group. The commissioners realized
that any rift between the groups would be detrimental to the
progress of the Coliseum; therefore, they offered the War
Memorial Commission the status of &ldquo;a public body to advise
and counsel with&rdquo; them. The commission unanimously accepted
this proposal, and full accord was re-established between
the two groups. The commission set up a planning
committee to work in close co-operation with the commissioners
and with Alvin M. Strauss, the architect for the
Coliseum.</p>
<p>In April, 1948, the planning committee and the county
commissioners scheduled a special meeting and invited representatives
from thirty-three civic, fraternal, and labor
organizations. Mr. Strauss presented his original plans
which called for an expenditure of four million dollars. He
also announced the retention of Elwood Allen, who had made
preliminary surveys, as recreational consultant.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>At this meeting the question of the proper seating capacity
arose. The president of the Fort Wayne Federation of
Labor, E. Robert Leach, speaking for his organization, advocated
fifteen thousand seats to accommodate Fort Wayne&rsquo;s
anticipated population growth. But the business manager
of the Zollner teams, Carl Bennett, expressed the opinion,
based on his individual experience, that a far smaller capacity
would suffice. If the capacity should consistently
prove greater than the need, the Coliseum would burden the
taxpayers for maintenance costs. On the other hand, the
Coliseum should be adequate in size to accommodate larger
audiences as the population increased over the years. In
order to ensure the most authoritative professional opinion,
the commissioners consulted the New Buildings Consulting
Board of the International Association of Auditorium Managers.
After conferring with that board the commissioners
agreed on a capacity of ten thousand. Judging from past
attendance records in Fort Wayne, it was decided that this
size would be more than adequate for most events but would
not create an extravagant community white elephant. The
Memorial Hall was also discussed during this time. The
War Memorial Commission appointed a committee of five
clergymen to work with the architect in planning this important
room. It was to be impressive and dignified.</p>
<p>The War Memorial Act provides that the Coliseum
shall be supervised by a five-man board of which no more
than three members may be affiliated with the same political
party. The board members shall serve without remuneration.
Appointed for a four-year term, they may be re-appointed
at the end of that period. The terms are staggered
so that all do not expire in any one year. Three members
shall be appointed by the county commissioners; two by the
circuit judge. The original board, appointed in June, 1949,
consisted of Otto H. Adams, James R. Fleming, Chester
V. Kimmell, Ramon S. Perry, and Alfred L. Randall. It
was the responsibility of the board to supervise the construction
and the operation of the building.</p>
<p>In December, 1949, the general construction contract
was awarded to the Hagerman Construction Company, who
submitted the low bid of $1,959,921. Bids were also accepted
for the heating and plumbing, electricity, seating,
sewerage, ice floor and refrigeration, and lockers. In each
case the low bid was accepted, and the aggregate amount
was under the three million dollar limit. All the awards
were made tentatively, pending the issuance of bonds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>In January, 1950, the commissioners announced that
the bid of the Chicago National Bank had been accepted for
the bond issue. The bank formed a syndicate with Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, and Beane; the Mercantile Commerce
Bank and Trust Company; Harris Hall and Company,
Incorporated; and the Fletcher Trust Company. A representative
of the Chicago banking house said that the excellent credit
and tax collection record of Allen County made the $27,445
premium possible. The interest rate is 1&frac12; per cent.</p>
<p>At long last the finances were arranged, the architect&rsquo;s
plans were approved, and the contracts were awarded;
now construction could begin. On January 24, 1950, just
three weeks after the bond issue had been floated, the ground-breaking
ceremony took place. Chester V. Kimmel, then
chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Coliseum, presided.
All county commissioners and trustees were present,
and representatives of various veterans and civic organizations
attended. The cornerstone was laid in November, 1951.
In the spring of 1952, the massive structure was nearly
completed. On Memorial Day the Allen County Council of
Veterans Organizations held a flag-raising ceremony to
mark the initiation of the final phase of construction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Board of Trustees began the arduous
task of compiling complete and accurate lists of the deceased
in order that the names might be inscribed on the plaques
in the Memorial Hall. No official list was available. Otto
H. Adams, the secretary of the Board of Trustees, searched
the records of the War Department and the veterans organizations.
The completed list was published in both Fort
Wayne newspapers; relatives and friends were earnestly
requested to notify the board of any corrections or omissions.
The roll of honor listed the names of 643 men and
women. The total has since been increased by the casualties
of the Korean conflict.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The Board of Trustees had the responsibility of choosing
a manager for the Coliseum. The duties of the manager
were to include the administration and operation of the building,
the supervision of personnel, and the scheduling of
events. The choice fell upon Don Myers, who had been a
most active promoter of the Coliseum since its inception.
The NEWS SENTINEL published an editorial commending
the choice and praising Mr. Myers: &ldquo;When others insisted
that it probably could not be done, he kept insisting that it
could be done and that he for one wasn&rsquo;t going to give up trying.
He didn&rsquo;t. He kept talking about the Memorial Coliseum
night and day, week in and week out.&rdquo; Mr. Myers has
proved an able manager; his work has won him recognition
in his profession, and he was awarded the trophy at the Auditorium
Operators Convention for his outstanding record
during the 1952-53 season.</p>
<p>During the construction period two changes occurred
on the Board of Trustees. Ramon S. Perry&rsquo;s term expired,
and Chester V. Kimmel, the chairman, resigned to go to
India under the Point Four Program. James R. Fleming,
who had served on the board since its beginning, was elected
chairman. Ellison L. Meier and Elmer Kolmerten were
appointed to fill the vacancies.</p>
<p>The War Memorial Coliseum was completed in September,
1952. Nearly eight years had elapsed since the
Junior Chamber of Commerce had conceived the idea of
erecting a suitable memorial to the war dead of Allen County.
The men who had worked unremittingly through those
years were amply rewarded when the building was opened
by impressive dedicatory services.</p>
<p>The dedication program was preceded by a parade in
which bands from all the city and county high schools and
representatives from twenty-four county veterans organizations
participated. The Great Lakes Naval Training Center
Band opened the ceremony. The Aeolian Choir of the General
Electric Company sang &ldquo;America, the Beautiful&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Battle Hymn of the Republic.&rdquo; Lewis K. Gough, the
National Commander of the American Legion, delivered the
principal address and said in part: &ldquo;This is the hallowed
hall of heroes ... this Memorial Coliseum, a living memorial
to our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters, our
fathers and our dear friends who served their God and their
country with the last full measure of devotion.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>The Coliseum is a remarkable structure. Mr. Strauss
has stated that a great many architectural problems had to
be solved in planning the edifice. The necessarily massive
size and isolated location might have resulted in an ill-proportioned
and bulky building. Fortunately, the judicious
adaptation of a contemporary modern style by the architects
has achieved a dignified building that is both functional and
beautiful. By placing the ramps between the levels on the
exterior, Mr. Strauss succeeded in overcoming bulky appearance.
The ramps modify a bluff fa&ccedil;ade of high vertical
walls and soften the relationship between the bulk of the
mass and the adjacent ground area.</p>
<p>The exterior of the octagonal building is brick and Indiana
limestone. The bricks are in three different hues to
provide variation in the broad expanse of the walls. Ten
rigid steel frames support the roof. Each frame weighs 70
tons and has a clear span of 239 feet&mdash;a longer span than
any other single-welded rigid framework ever erected in the
United States. The dimensions of the Coliseum are impressive:
425 feet in length, 300 feet in width, and 87 feet in
height from the floor of the main arena.</p>
<p>One problem in the construction of a great building
arises from discrepancies in the rates of expansion and contraction
of various materials used. In the Coliseum the
concrete seating construction is attached to the steel frame
of the building by a device operating on the principle of a
hinge. It is so designed that when the steel and concrete
expand at different coefficients, the hinge moves to adjust
to the disparity. Careful consideration has been given to
facilitating the ingress and egress of spectators. The upper
main seating area is served by sixteen vomitory entrances,
and the lower arena by four. The multiple entrances make
it possible to empty the building very rapidly after each
performance and are an important safety factor in case of
emergency.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>As the president of the Junior Chamber of Commerce
had promised in the earliest plans for the Coliseum, the
memorial to the war dead is the focal point of the building.
The main entrance on the north leads directly to the Memorial
Hall. Five cast aluminum heads have been placed on
the exterior of the building above the windows of the hall.
These heads symbolize the Army, Navy, Marine Corps,
Coast Guard, and Air Force. The interior of the august hall
measures seventy-five feet in length and thirty feet in width.
Four kinds of marble are used in the decoration: French
Notre Dame for the background, English Renfrew for the
inserts, Italian Red Levanto for the platform, and Spanish
Bois Jourdan for the door panels. Two bronze plaques, one
at either end of the hall, list the casualties of Allen County
beneath the following inscription: &ldquo;This Coliseum is dedicated
as a living memorial in honor of these men and women
who gave their lives in World Wars I and II of the nation so
that we might live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sports Arena has an area of approximately 25,000
square feet. There are 7,250 permanent seats in the upper
seating area, and additional temporary seats can be erected
to bring the total capacity to 10,500. The windowless room
is lighted by a battery of 220 one-thousand watt lamps. The
concrete floor is inlaid with almost ten miles of pipe through
which brine is pumped to form ice on the floor. A layer of
ice from three eighths to three fourths of an inch thick
freezes in twelve hours. After an ice show or a hockey
game the ice is thawed to slush and scraped into a large pit
to melt and drain away. A portable basketball floor can
then be installed; the floor consists of 214 four by eight feet
sections which can be joined by means of an electric screw
driver in two hours. For theatrical or musical productions
a portable stage is erected.</p>
<p>Two notable features in the arena are the electric
scoreboard and the organ. The first was purchased for the
Coliseum by Wolf and Dessauer at a cost of $30,000 and is
one of the finest existing scoreboards in the country. Spectators
in every section of the arena can easily read one of
its four faces. Mrs. Ida Dick of the Dick Piano and Organ
Company donated the organ in memory of her husband.</p>

<p class="pcap">a southwest view of the
Coliseum showing the entrance

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The Exhibition Hall occupies the lower level of the
building and covers an acre and a quarter in area. The hall
provides ideal accommodations for agricultural and industrial
exhibits such as the 4-H Club Fair and the Automobile
Show. Because the level has its own separate box office,
lobby, and concession stand, events can be scheduled concurrently
with those in the Sports Arena without interference.
Ramps connect the two levels.</p>
<p>The Coliseum has brought many benefits to Fort Wayne.
Local organizations have better facilities for their activities.
For example, the 4-H Clubs held their annual fair in
the Exhibition Hall and were untroubled by uncertainties of
weather. Recently, the Board of Trustees leased sixteen
acres adjacent to the building to this group. The Boy Scouts
served 1,500 guests at their annual recognition dinner in
the Coliseum. During the Christmas season, the Christ
Child Festival is held there. Now the regional high school
basketball tournaments can be held in Fort Wayne.</p>
<p>An important benefit arises from the major sports
events and appearances of famous entertainers. The stars
of stage and screen and of the world of sports bring many
visitors to Fort Wayne; increased business results for the
merchants and the hotel and restaurant owners. Sports
announcers and reviewers give much favorable publicity to
Fort Wayne because of our fine Coliseum. Thus, the Coliseum,
besides honoring the war dead of the community, is
a great asset to the citizens of the community. The building
admirably fulfills the dual role of a &ldquo;living memorial.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">OTTO H. ADAMS</span></h2>
<p>Otto H. Adams was one of the first appointees to the
War Memorial Commission, which was organized in 1946 to
plan a coliseum. He served as a member until the commission
was superseded by the Coliseum Board of Trustees; he
was then appointed to this official governing body. In January,
1954, he was elected president of the board; previously
he had been vice-president and secretary.</p>
<p>The son of William C. and Sophia (Felger) Adams,
Otto Adams was born June 5, 1894, in Allen County, Indiana.
After completing secondary school, he continued his
education at the Indiana University Extension Center in Fort
Wayne. For a number of years Mr. Adams was employed
by the Indiana Service Corporation. In 1939 he was named
General Superintendent of City Utilities; and from 1943 to
1947 he served as City Controller. In 1947 he accepted his
present position as controller at Zollner Machine Works,
Incorporated.</p>
<p>The United Commercial Travelers elected Mr. Adams
&ldquo;Man of the Year&rdquo; in 1952 in recognition of his record of
community leadership. An editorial in the FORT WAYNE
NEWS-SENTINEL on February 9, 1953, commented: &ldquo;The
long-time Fort Wayne civic leader has so many notable facets
of achievement in civic leadership, charitable endeavor,
and generally unselfish service to his credit that it is virtually
impossible to enumerate them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Otto Adams served as chairman of the Allen County
Chapter of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis
for seven years. He has served on the directorates of numerous
civic organizations, including the Fort Wayne Chamber
of Commerce, the Allen County Chapter of the American
Red Cross, and the Y.M.C.A. He has held office as
president of the Lakeside Northeast Community Association
and as treasurer of the Anthony Wayne Council of Boy Scouts.
He was also a member of the organizing committee of the
United Fund. Long associated with the Republican party in
Fort Wayne, he has been treasurer of the Allen County Republican
Central Committee since 1950.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>A veteran of World War I, Otto Adams is active in
the American Legion. He is a Mason and is a member of the
Quest Club and the Elks. He attends the Trinity English
Lutheran Church. Mr. Adams is married and is the father
of four children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">JAMES R. FLEMING</span></h2>
<p>James R. Fleming was elected president of the Board
of Trustees of the Coliseum in 1952 prior to the dedication
of the building. He retained that post until January, 1954.
His term of office included a rather critical and very successful
period in the operation of the Coliseum.</p>
<p>James R. Fleming was born November 8, 1881, in
Henry County, Indiana; his parents were George R. and Sarah
(Cummins) Fleming. He completed his elementary and
secondary education in local schools and was awarded the
degree of Bachelor of Law at the University of Michigan in
1904.</p>
<p>After graduation the young lawyer began his practice
at Portland, Indiana, where he was soon elected Prosecuting
Attorney for Jay County. He was later elected to the Indiana
General Assembly and served several years both in the lower
house and in the state senate. In 1933 President Roosevelt
appointed Mr. Fleming United States Attorney for the
Northern District of Indiana. Many notorious criminals then
operated in this area; James Fleming held office between
1933 and 1941 and successfully prosecuted many of these
gangsters.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">DON L. MYERS</span></h2>
<p>Don L. Myers was chosen manager of the War Memorial
Coliseum in 1951 prior to the completion of the edifice;
he continues in that capacity at the present time. Wide recognition
has been accorded him; he was awarded a trophy by
the International Association of Auditorium Managers for
his efficient and successful management during the 1952-1953
season.</p>
<p>Mr. Myers was born in Wolcottville, Indiana, February
12, 1914. He accompanied his family to Fort Wayne in
1929, attended North Side High School, and graduated in
1931. His first positions were in sales promotion and hotel
work; during World War II he was employed in the essential
steel industry. He was sales manager for the V. R. Myers
Pump Supply Company before his appointment as manager
of the Coliseum.</p>
<p>In 1942 Don Myers joined the Fort Wayne Junior Chamber
of Commerce and was soon an active member. Through
his associations in the &ldquo;Jaycees,&rdquo; he became a proponent
of the Coliseum. Mr. Myers assisted in the formulation of
the initial plans for the memorial, and when the War Memorial
Commission was organized to execute the plans, he
was chosen president. Later, when the memorial building
was under construction, he was elected to the Allen County
Council. As a councilman, he used his opportunities to expedite
the progress of the Coliseum. Don Myers is a member
of the First Baptist Church. He is married and is the
father of two children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">ALVIN M. STRAUSS</span></h2>
<p>The Commissioners of Allen County selected A. M.
Strauss, Incorporated, to design the War Memorial Coliseum
because of the notable achievements of the firm and because
that architectural corporation could complete all
phases of structural planning. Thus, the need for employing
architects from other cities would be obviated.</p>
<p>Alvin M. Strauss, born April 8, 1895, at Kendallville,
Indiana, was the son of Abraham and Frieda Strauss. After
the completion of his secondary education in the city of his
birth in 1912, he was employed for several years in architectural
offices in Fort Wayne and Chicago. His career was
interrupted during the first World War by military service.
Following his discharge in 1918, Mr. Strauss returned to
Fort Wayne and opened his own office of architectural consultants.
Mechanical, electrical, and structural engineering
personnel were added to the staff in the 1940&rsquo;s. The
firm was incorporated in 1950 under the name of A. M.
Strauss, Incorporated.</p>
<p>Mr. Strauss is a director of the Indiana Society of
Architects and a member of the state Architects&rsquo; Registration
Board. In addition to these professional organizations,
he is a member of the Jewish Federation, the Executives
Club, the Elks Lodge, and the Fort Wayne Country Club.
He is married and resides at 1220 Illsley Drive.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
